2048Algo
========

This is a program which dosn't concentrate on the graphical elements but gives focus to the logical part of the famous game 2048...Probably this might be a lot of help for the programming beginners.In this program to have more focus on  ALGORITHM and less focus on GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE I have used python non standard libraries which are only available in CodeSkulptor(www.codeskulptor.com). So to check the working of the code you have to run this souce code in CodeSkulptor...Thank You..,
