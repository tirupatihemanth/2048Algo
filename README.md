2048Algo
========

This is a program which dosn't concentrate on the graphical elements but gives focus to the logical part of the famous game 2048...Probably this might be a lot of help for the programming beginners.In this program to have more focus on  ALGORITHM and less focus on GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE I have used python non standard libraries which are only available in CodeSkulptor(www.codeskulptor.com). So to check the working of the code you have to run this souce code in CodeSkulptor... and by the way if you have any queries you can visit <a href = "http://neon001.blogspot.in/2014/07/beginningwith-game-2048.html" target = "blank">my blog</a> Thank You..,
